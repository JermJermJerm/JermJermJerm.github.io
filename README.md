# About
This repo is where I throw all of my small projects, whether they're finished or not - but mostly finished

[scripts and styles folders are not projects, they're just for the home page]

As of August 3, 2017, projects include

* **cases:** some string manipulation, all caps, all lower, and exploded w spaces
also allows you to distinguish a lowercase L from a capital i

* **mini:** minify text, and then copy it with a click of a button
just wanted to see if I could do it

* **NewUtilities:** datacenter utilities app. don't worry bout it

* **StupidDumb:** translate text into emojis, specifically regional-indicators
stolen/adapted idea from a friend, originally made in C++, but I couldn't download his executable :/

* **suns:** splits randomizer prototype in the making
aimed to make speedrunning IL practice less repetitive

* **RemoveSpacesExplodeStrings:** Split strings with a specified delimiter
originally made so I could see where I should put cURL on my work pc because paths were all in one string separated by semicolons,
and therefore hard to read.
