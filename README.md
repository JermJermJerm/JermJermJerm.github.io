# About
This repo is where I throw all of my small projects, whether they're finished or not - but mostly finished

[scripts and styles folders are not projects, they're just for the home page]

As of September 4, 2017, projects include

* **cases:** some string manipulation, all caps, all lower, and exploded w spaces
also allows you to distinguish a lowercase L from a capital i

* **charges-calculator:** A simple calculator for determining how much you would have to pay in one-time costs and recurring payments (payment plans) over a given amount of time - separately and equal. 
In my example, months are used as the period of time.
This tool could be useful for calculating things like bills (car, phone, cable, rent), budgets, or estimating profits.

* **minifier:** minify text, and then copy it with a click of a button
just wanted to see if I could do it

* **PWGen:** customizable password generator

* **StringExplosion:** Split strings with a specified delimiter
originally made so I could see where I should put cURL on my work pc because paths were all in one string separated by semicolons,
and therefore hard to read.

* **StupidDumb:** translate text into emojis, specifically regional-indicators
stolen/adapted idea from a friend, originally made in C++, but I couldn't download his executable :/

* **SunsSR:** splits randomizer prototype in the making
aimed to make speedrunning IL practice less repetitive

* **LiveSplit Dashboard:** A web-based dashboard for controlling LiveSplit via the LiveSplit Server component.
