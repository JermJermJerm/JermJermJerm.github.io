			<li id="descLine1"><span class="highlight">Jerm</span> is a nickname I was given by my family and friends separately but equally.</li>
			<li id="descLine2">My family felt the pronunciation of <span class="highlight">Jeremy</span> was cumbersome, especially with most of the family members having English as a second language. 
				At one point I was <span class="highlight">Jerms</span>, and then they dropped the <span class="highlight">s</span> and I became Jerm.</li>
			<li id="descLine3">My friends just liked to give me nicknames with a <span class="highlight">J</span> pronounced at the beginning. I was Jerome before becoming Jerm.</li>
